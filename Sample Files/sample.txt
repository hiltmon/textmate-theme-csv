Up to a foot of heavy, wet snow could fall in some areas of Massachusetts this weekend, which could result in downed tree limbs and scattered power outages, forecasters said. The storm is expected to crawl up the state, moving from south to north, beginning with rain along the coast just after 3 p.m. Saturday. The storm will intensify Saturday night and then taper off Sunday afternoon, said meteorologist Charlie Foley.
