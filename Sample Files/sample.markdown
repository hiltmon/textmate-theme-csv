The word **default** has many meanings:

* To a **geek** means the value set for a preference by the developer, as in “the default value for the web server port is 80”.
* To a **finance person** means the failure to fulfill an obligation, like pay off a security, as in “the company’s corporate bond is in default”.
* To a **sports person** means the failure of a team to arrive in time to participate in a sports match, thereby losing the match, as in “Qatar lose the soccer game by default to Uzbekistan”.
* To a **lawyer** means the failure to appear in court, as in “an order for default as entered in case XYZZY”.
* And to **everyone else** means “De Fault”, as in “the replacement ref’s incompetence is *de fault* of the league.”

Just a quick reminder to ensure you use the right terms in the right context for the right audience.
